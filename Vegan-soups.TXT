(Vegan-Soups)

[]

INGREDIENTS
1 Tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil or vegetable oil
3 garlic cloves, thinly sliced
1 1” piece ginger, peeled, finely chopped
2 Tbsp. miso
1 Tbsp. soy sauce
2 tsp. unseasoned rice vinegar or apple cider vinegar
½ tsp. toasted sesame oil
½ tsp. Aleppo-style pepper or ¼ tsp. crushed red pepper flakes, plus more for serving if desired
2 oz. shiitake or crimini mushrooms, trimmed, thinly sliced
1 cup mixed peas (such as baby and/or trimmed snow and/or sugar snap, halved if large)
1 large egg, lightly beaten, or 8 oz. silken tofu or 2.5 oz. yuba sheets
Kosher salt

substiute egg for tofu

RECIPE PREPARATION
Heat olive oil in a medium saucepan over medium. Cook garlic and ginger, stirring often, until softened and very fragrant, about 3 minutes. Add 3 cups water. Combine miso and 2 Tbsp. water in a small bowl and stir to dissolve miso. Whisk into aromatics, then add soy sauce, vinegar, sesame oil, and ½ tsp. Aleppo-style pepper. Increase heat to medium-high and bring to a simmer. Reduce heat as needed to maintain a simmer and cook until flavors come together, about 10 minutes.

Add mushrooms and peas and cook until crisp-tender, about 3 minutes. Gently stir in the egg (a few turns of a spoon will be enough to set it into ribbons without blasting it apart) and cook until just set, about 30 seconds. Or, if using tofu, drop in by spoonfuls, or if using yuba, thinly slice before adding, and cook just until heated through, about 1 minute. Season with salt.

Ladle soup into bowls and sprinkle with more Aleppo-style pepper if desired.
