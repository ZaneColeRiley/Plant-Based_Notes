INGREDIENTS
6 Tbsp. grapeseed or other neutral oil
2 tsp. ras-el-hanout
1 garlic clove, finely grated
2 Tbsp. fresh lemon juice
2 Tbsp. white balsamic vinegar or white wine vinegar
1 Tbsp. honey
Kosher salt, freshly ground pepper
¼ cup raw pistachios
1 small shallot, finely chopped
1 medium jalapeño, finely chopped
6 cups finely chopped broccoli florets and peeled stems (from about 1 bunch)
1 cup finely chopped cilantro
⅓ cup finely chopped pitted dates

RECIPE PREPARATION
Heat oil, ras-el-hanout, and garlic in a small saucepan over medium-high until fragrant, about 2 minutes. Remove from heat and whisk in lemon juice, vinegar, and honey. Season vinaigrette with salt and pepper; set aside.

Toast pistachios in a small skillet over medium-low heat until golden brown, about 4 minutes. Transfer to a cutting board and let cool; finely chop.

Toss pistachios, shallot, jalapeño, broccoli, cilantro, and dates in a medium bowl. Drizzle dressing over and toss to coat. Taste and season with more salt and pepper if needed.

Do ahead: Salad can be made 1 day ahead. Cover and chill.
